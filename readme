This is a hack to drive a stepper motor with acceleration based on Atmel's AVR446 application note.
You need PyPRUSS.

Usage:
python stepper.py <num steps> <speed> <accel> <decel>

For example: 500000 steps at 100 rad/s (assuming 200 step/rev motor with 1/32 microstepping)
python stepper.py 500000 100 500 500

It will drive GPIO0 pin 27 with a positive flank for each step.
